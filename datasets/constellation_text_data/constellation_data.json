It is also the third largest of all the constellations.The Ancient Greeks identified Ursa Major as a bear \u2013 its name is Latin for \u2018the greater bear\u2019. Some historians believe this tradition dates back at least 10,000 years.Together with Orion and the Pleiades (M45), it is one of only three astronomical entities which appear in the Bible.All but one of the seven stars which make up the main body of the Big Dipper are second-magnitude stars. The star Mizar, which forms the bend in the ladle's handle, is in fact a double-star with a close neighbor Alcor, which can easily be seen with the unaided eye. The ability to distinguish them is often quoted as having been an ancient sight test, though most people are able to do so.The stars Merak and Dubhe are often called the \u2018pointer stars\u2019 because they form a line which points directly to Polaris, the pole star.Ursa Major also contains countless deep sky objects, including the bright face-on spiral galaxy M81 and its close companion M82. Close to the handle of the ladle lies the Pinwheel Galaxy (M101).In Greek mythology, Ursa Major is identified as Callisto, one of Zeus' many lovers. It is one of three constellations which commemorate what is surely the most unsuccessful meet-the-parents dinner party in history.Zeus was having an affair with Callisto, and they'd just had a child called Arcas. Zeus thought he'd turn up at her father's house for dinner, but it all started going wrong when his lover's father thought it would be a clever idea to test whether it was really Zeus, by chopping up Arcas and putting him in the stew (eh?).Unfortunately, the dinner guest really was Zeus, and he got rather annoyed. Thunderbolts flew in all directions, killing all of Callisto's brothers. Callisto got turned into a bear, her father turned into a wolf. But luckily Zeus was able to reassemble all the bits of Arcas and bring him back to life, with a bit of help from Maia.But Zeus forgot to tell Arcas that his mother was now a bear, so he started hunting her with a spear. Realising it had all gone horribly wrong, Zeus decided there was nothing for it but to put Arcas in the sky as the constellation Bootes, Callisto in the sky as Ursa Major, and her father in the sky as the wolf, Lupus. Maia, meanwhile, is the central star of the Pleiades (M45).","additional_info":{"Date First Appeared":"Ancient","Sky Area":"3.1% of the sky 1279.7 square degrees","Messier Objects":"Ursa Major contains the following Messier objects: M40 , M81 , M82 , M97 , M101 , M108 , M109 .","Caldwell Objects":"Ursa Major contains no Caldwell objects","Neighbors":"The following constellations neighbor Ursa Major: Bootes , Camelopardalis , Canes Venatici , Coma Berenices , Draco , Leo , Leo Minor , Lynx ."},"img_src":"https:\/\/in-the-sky.org\/data\/charts\/UMA_1_sm.png"},"genitive_form":"Ursae Majoris","brightest_star":"Alioth","brightest_star_info":{"description":"From Washington          ,         Alioth is visible in both the dusk and dawn skies.

Argo Navis covered over 4% of the sky, an area 25% larger than the biggest modern constellation, Hydra.In 1763, Nicolas Louis de Lacaille divided it up into three parts: Carina, Puppis and Vela. As a result of this relatively recent subdivision, the Bayer designations (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, etc) are split between the stars of the three constellations.In classical mythology, Argo Navis was the ship sailed by Jason and the Argonauts on their voyage to recover the golden fleece.
